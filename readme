PvPTracker is a simple WoW tracking hack designed for use in PvP environment.
Supports version 3.3.5.
While it is running, nearby players will be shown on the mini map.
In addition a tiny window is placed on top of the game to see number of hostile and friendly players around you.
To start/stop use Ctrl + Alt + T shortcut.
You can drag the window to any place on the screen and position will be saved between runs.

Provided AS IS without any warranty. Feel free to do whatever you want with it.
I do not recommend using it on retail servers.
